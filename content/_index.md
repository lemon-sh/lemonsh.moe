Hello there!

I'm **lemonsh**, a tech guy from Poland. I'm interested in \*nix operating systems, networking, programming, retro-computing and electronics. I also love making music, cycling, photography and graphic design.

I mainly code in Rust, but I also know C, C#, Java, HTML/CSS, Bash, some x86 ASM, and a bit of JS. My first language was Python, but I don't use it much anymore.

I proudly run Alpine Linux on all of my servers and co-maintain the [C4TG1RL5 (AS4242421411)](https://catgirls.systems) network on [dn42](https://dn42.us/) with [famfo](https://famfo.xyz).
