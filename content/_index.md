Hello there!

I'm **lemonsh**, a random tech guy from Poland. I'm interested in \*nix operating systems, networking, programming, retro-computing and electronics. I also like making music and graphic design.

These days I mainly code in Rust, but I also know C, C#, Java, HTML/CSS, Bash, some x86 ASM, and a bit of JS. I'm currently learning Kotlin and planning to learn Go in the future. My first language was Python, but I don't use it anymore.

I run Arch Linux on my laptop and PC, Alpine Linux on all of my servers. I co-maintain the [C4TG1RL5 (AS4242421411)](https://catgirls.lemonsh.moe) network on [dn42](https://dn42.us/) with [famfo](https://famfo.xyz).

Yes, I like anime. I know you didn't ask.
