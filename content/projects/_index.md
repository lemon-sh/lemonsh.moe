* [`uberbot`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/uberbot) (`Rust`) - IRC bot that does... I don't even know what anymore. Originally intended to replace the 6 bots on karx's IRC server with one bot.

### Toys
Very small projects written out of boredom, or to prove a point.

* [`sntp-yield`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/sntp-yield) (`Rust`) - Super accurate clock, thanks to Google's NTP service.
* [`lemontimer`](https://gist.github.com/lemon-sh/512223b4c97bf61cf3fdb7c97283b2ef) (`x86 Assembly`) - Desktop clock for Windows. Written in ASM while waiting in an Overwatch DPS queue.

* [`defralloc`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/defralloc) (`C`) - Defragmenting memory "allocator". Don't even bother.

### R.I.P
Stuff that's not functional and not developed anymore (most likely because interest has been lost).

* [`spotk`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/spotk) (`Rust`) - CLI tool for retrieving song metadata from Spotify's API. The project unfortunately died due to anti-competitive API changes introduced by Spotify.
* [`uonet-rs`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/uonet-rs) (`Rust`) - Library for interacting with my school's e-journal app.
* [`vidns`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/vidns) (`Rust`) - PowerDNS Frontend for use in small networks to allow users to create their own domains and manage their DNS records.
