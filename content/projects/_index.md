This list exists mainly for myself, so I can organize my time better, but feel free to check it out if you're interested in what I do.
### Work-in-progress
Stuff I'm currently working on.

* [`vidns`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/vidns) (`Rust`) - PowerDNS Frontend for use in small networks to allow users to create their own domains and manage their DNS records.
* [`IRCrarria`](https://github.com/lemon-sh/IRCrarria) (`C#`) - IRC bridge for Terraria (TShock plugin).
* [`qbin`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/qbin) (`Rust`) - Like [termbin.com](https://termbin.com/), but done my way.
* [`dn42wiki-ng`](https://git.dn42.dev/wiki/wiki-ng) (`Zola`) - A rewrite of the original gollum dn42 wiki to Zola, for better performance and appearance.
* [`dsuft`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/dsuft) (`C`) - Simple file transfer utility for *nix OSes, I'm planning to rewrite this in Rust, because of the maintenance burden.

### Maintenance
Projects that I used to work on, but rarely do currently. These are either completed or I just simply lost interest in working on them, perhaps temporarily.

* [`uberbot`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/uberbot) (`Rust`) - IRC bot that does... I don't even know anymore. Originally intended to replace the 6 bots on karx's IRC server with one bot.
* [`SMSBot`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/SMSBot) (`Java`) - Android command chatbot (kinda like Discord bots) working over SMS.
* [`chuncord`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/chuncord) (`Rust`) - Abuse Discord's 8MB limit by splitting the file in chunks.
* [`algcalc`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/algcalc) (`C/C++`) - The software for a "gaming calculator" that I've built with my friend from school.
* [`ZDIMGUPMobile`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/ZDIMGUPMobile) (`Java`) - Android app that uploads files to Discord through a webhook and then gives you the direct hotlink. Originally intended for sending images in IRC channels.
* [`windimgup`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/windimgup) (`C/C++`) - Win32 version of the above.
* [`dimgup3`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/dimgup3) (`Rust`) - Web version of the above.
* [`zdiu`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/zdiu) (`Rust`) - GTK3 version of the above.

### Toys
Very small projects written out of boredom, or to prove a point.

* [`sntp-yield`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/sntp-yield) (`Rust`) - Super accurate clock, thanks to Google's NTP service.
* [`defralloc`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/defralloc) (`C`) - Defragmenting memory "allocator". Don't even bother.
* [`lemontimer`](https://gist.github.com/lemon-sh/512223b4c97bf61cf3fdb7c97283b2ef) (`x86 Assembly`) - Desktop clock for Windows. Written in ASM while waiting in an Overwatch DPS queue.
* [`binshclock`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/binshclock) (`C`) - Desktop ***binary*** clock for Windows.

### Stuck
Projects that are blocked for some reason (e.g. requiring a rewrite). If you want to annoy me, remind me about one of these.

* [`uonet-rs`](https://git.lemonsh.moe/lemon/uonet-rs) (`Rust`) - Library for interacting with my school's e-journal app.
